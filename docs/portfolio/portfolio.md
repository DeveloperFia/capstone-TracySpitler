## Sprint 1

__What have you learned this week?__

I feel like I have learned the GitHub workflow pretty well. It has kept the development of my project organized and accessible. I also have learned to clarify what my ideas are a little more. Sometimes this can be challenging for me.

__Did you do any independent research outside of what was required?​__

I play music so research this week was particularly enlightening for me. I watched a video this week titled [Lessons Learned from a Decade of Audio Programming​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjm--AqG04Y). During this video, one thing Somberg said that really struck me was when he was talking about lowering sounds that are less important. This could be extremely useful for the song playback part of the app - getting rid of vocals and perhaps even tuning some other noises down to make it easier to play along with, kind of like background music.

__How can you improve based on your experiences this week? What were your strengths and weaknesses? How was your experience with your assignments? Did you manage time wisely?__

Time wasn't on my side this week. Or perhaps I wasn't on time's side. Either way, next week will be more productive. The hardest part of building a project for me is the starting point. There are a lot of decisions to be made in the first week. I'm not always sure about the details until a bit later. However, this class' workflow with GitHub has helped me clarify what I expect out of the project. The evolution of the project over the next few weeks gets a bit easier.

__Did you see anything cool this week? Learn about a new rock star in the industry? Attend a meetup? Learning a new language or technique?__

I didn't do any networking this week, but I did watch video that piqued my interest titled [Your Brain on Music​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZFFwy5fwYI). This is a TED talk by neuroscientist and musician Alan Harvey. He talks about how music is processed, and how it's responsible for much more than we realize. There is another neuroscientist and musician, Andrew Price that wears this cap that to show the audience his electrical signals and how they change based on what music is being played. It's interesting and will give you a few laughs.

## Sprint 2

__What have you learned this week?__

I have learned a lot about user testing and unit testing. At the beginning of the week, I met up with a few friends for their opinion and feedback on my project. I received a great deal of candid input. I believe this was because I created an open environment and prefaced the testing by letting them know all questions, thoughts, and reactions are encouraged and come with no judgment. It's not always easy to explain why something makes you feel a certain way, or why you like or dislike something.

Unit testing is something I fell behind learning in the last class (ASL).  I feel like I have learned enough about it to say with certainty that I have caught up, though there is still much to learn.  

__Did you do any independent research outside of what was required? (Share links, images, files, or code snippets to emphasize your knowledge. This is your chance to shine. What interests you? How did you go above and beyond what was expected?)__

This week I did quite a bit of research on SVG files and how I can create and manipulate them. I will need to have a way to display the guitar chord to the user, and dynamically generated SVG images would be great. I found an npm package called chordy-svg, however, I'm apprehensive because their site only has C chords, and the documentation states that open strings are not properly tested. I did find an incredibly useful SVG library. It allows easy manipulation and animation of SVG files. I intend to play around with it very soon.

__How can you improve based on your experiences this week? What were your strengths and weaknesses? How was your experience with your assignments? Did you manage time wisely?__

One weakness is without a doubt making decisions at the beginning of it all and feeling certain about my project ideas and implementation. The design aspect is another. It takes me longer than I think it should just to build a basic design mock-up. Hopefully, practice will help me in this area.

I am assuredly getting better at managing my time wisely. The difference between this week and last is incredible. A strength of mine is that once I have requirements set and a solid foundation to start with, I can truly dig in and gain some momentum. It feels nice to have the base code of the project up and running. I'm eager to extend the development and observe the evolution of the project next week.

Sometimes templating in Pug can be difficult because it's easy to miss indentations and it is pretty unforgiving when that happens. I use Atom for my editor, and I found a package that beautifies a bunch of different coding languages, including Pug. This package helps to ensure that my application won't break because of a simple overlook of spacing. The package has an option to Beautify on Save, which is another great perk. _Check it out:_ https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify​.
