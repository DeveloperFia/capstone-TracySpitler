## Brief

The Brief is an executive summary of the Audience, their problem, and your proposed solution. This should boil down to one long paragraph, devoting one, maybe two sentences, to each of the sections defined.

### Audience

Define the primary as well as any secondary audiences. The more specific the better. Identify any defining characteristics that will influence design considerations. 

When selecting a Primary Audience consider that yes, *anyone* could use your service, but who is your ideal user and why. If you are running a convenience store are you targeting *everyone* as a customer, or have you researched the products that a specific age and income bracket are interested in.

### Problem

Clearly and succinctly define the problem your audience is having, for which you intend to develop a web-based solution.

> Cite research or feedback from interviews with your audience. 

### Solution

Identify any competition operating in this market space and summarize how they are addressing the problem, as defined.

Define your solution and how it will directly address the problem your audience is having.

> Define your the competition operating within this market.

### Unique Value Proposition

What separates you from the competition? How are you able to better solve this defined problem for your audience than your competition? Why is your idea smarter, more efficient, or better?

### User Stories

Link to issues filtered to the label "[user story](#)".

## Spec

### Sitemap

Create and label a hierarchical diagram that identifies all user facing screens. This will be the road map your instructors and you will use to converse about various screens and to examine user flows between screens.

### Interface

#### Information Architecture

Using your sitemap as a base structure, use this section to house ALL of your text content. This is a great place to develop all of the content that will appear on your pages, components, and sub sections outside of the constraints of code. In MVC we separate views from controllers and models, while in the Information Architecture section of your project spec you will separate your content from your code.


### Infrastructure

### Technical Requirements

Define the server software and hardware, virtualized or not, that your application requires to run. These should be in a format of Title: Brief description of my usage. If a feature as defined in the issues requires a specific technology, that issue should cite this as well. 

> Example: Technical Requirement - FFMPEG
> Server side service to handle video. Needed to extract single frames to turn into thumbnails.

> Example: Issue - Thumbnail Generate:
> Detailed description of the usage I intend to do... how exactly that will work for the user.
> Technical Requirement: FFMPEG

### Programming Languages

Identify what programming languages you are using. Provide links to their respective documentation sites.

### Integrations

Identify what 3rd party packages, libraries, or external integrations you are using. Provide links to their respective documentation sites.

### Deployment Workflow

Document the release process for your application from new feature creation through live deployment. This will be heavily focused on this week's research.

### Web Host

Define what hosting service provider you will be utilizing and identify the accessible urls of any live or staging servers for review.
